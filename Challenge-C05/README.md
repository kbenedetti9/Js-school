* **Proposed design:** To have a better view of what we had to do, look the specific details and CSS code I used figma. 

### What I did

## For general design

I did the design by parts, starting at the top, doing at first the navigation bar with all the elements and finishing with the containers of all the books. I worked mainly with grid system, dividing the most part of the design by columns and rows.
I applied bootstrap for some elements because is easier to did it in that way.

## For responsive design 

I applied media query by defining the elements that I wanted to show and resizing and repositioning the components I wanted to move to look better in smaller devices.

## For the action of click on a book

To show the user the complete information of the book they select I applied a little bit of javaScript to did a function that shows the information od the book only when is click on it, also to disappear it when the user click on it again.

The *index.html* and *styles.css* files were commented.
